# online-learning-platform

The Online Learning Platform is a web-based application that provides a full-featured system for managing students, instructors, courses, exams, and more. The system is designed using a Microservice Architecture with Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) for backend logic and REST APIs to expose services. This platform allows administrators, instructors, students, and test centers to manage accounts, create and enroll in courses, view and update exams, and much more.

Key Features:
Admin Role: Manage users, courses, and platform usage.
Instructor Role: Create courses, manage student enrollments, and interact with students.
Student Role: Register, enroll in courses, provide reviews, and view grades.
Test Center: Create exams, grade students, and manage exam schedules.

Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
Stateless EJB:

Used for services where there is no client-specific state maintained between method invocations. E.g., handling course searches and enrollments.
Stateful EJB:

Maintains client-specific state. For instance, managing a student’s current course enrollment session or an instructor’s course creation process.
Singleton EJB:

Used for managing shared resources like platform-wide statistics, ensuring a single instance handles all requests for resource management.
Message Driven EJB:

Handles asynchronous processing, such as sending notifications or handling background tasks like email alerts for course updates.
REST APIs:

Expose backend services to clients. Each EJB service is exposed via RESTful web services, allowing external communication via HTTP.
Microservices Architecture
Microservice Design:

The system should be divided into multiple services, each handling distinct responsibilities.
Example: One service for User Management, another for Course Management, and a third for Exam Management.
Service Communication:

Microservices will interact with each other via RESTful APIs. For instance, a course service may request user data from the user management service to verify enrollments.
Independent Databases:

Each microservice will have its own database or data store to ensure independence and separation of concerns. For example, the user management service will handle user accounts, while the course management service stores course data.
Languages and Frameworks:

You can develop microservices in Java using EJB or use other frameworks (like Spring) for some services.
Use REST APIs to expose each service's functionalities to the front en
